  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <div class="section-inner">
      <h2>Summary of The Little Prince</h2>
      <p>The Little Prince is a philosophical fable written and illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, first published in 1943. Though often classified as a children&#39;s book, its themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss resonate deeply with adult readers. The story is narrated by a pilot stranded in the Sahara Desert who encounters a mysterious young boy—the Little Prince—who has traveled to Earth from a tiny asteroid called B-612.</p>
          <p>The narrator begins by recalling his childhood, when he drew a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an elephant. Adults consistently mistook the drawing for a hat, which taught the narrator that grown-ups lack imagination and only understand things when expressed in numbers and practical terms. This sets up one of the book&#39;s central themes: the contrast between the imaginative, emotionally honest world of children and the rigid, superficial world of adults.</p>
          <p>The Little Prince describes his home asteroid, which is so small that he can watch the sunset multiple times a day simply by moving his chair. He tends to three volcanoes and wages a constant battle against baobab trees, whose roots could destroy his tiny world if left unchecked. Most importantly, he cares for a single rose that appeared one day on his planet. The rose is vain and demanding, and the prince, not yet understanding the nature of love, grows frustrated with her. He decides to leave his planet and explore the universe.</p>
          <p>During his journey, the Little Prince visits six other asteroids, each inhabited by a single adult who represents a different human folly. The king on the first planet insists on ruling over everything, even the stars, but has no subjects. The conceited man on the second planet wants only to be admired. The drunkard on the third drinks to forget the shame of drinking. The businessman on the fourth obsessively counts stars, believing he owns them. The lamplighter on the fifth planet faithfully lights and extinguishes his lamp every minute as his planet spins faster and faster—he is the only one the prince respects because he serves something other than himself. The geographer on the sixth planet records information about places he has never visited.</p>
          <p>These encounters serve as a satirical commentary on the absurdities of adult life: the obsession with power, vanity, addiction, materialism, mindless duty, and theoretical knowledge divorced from experience. Each character is isolated and unfulfilled, having lost touch with what truly matters.</p>
          <p>On Earth, the Little Prince meets a snake who speaks in riddles and offers to help him return home someday. He encounters a garden full of roses and is initially devastated to discover that his rose is not unique—there are thousands just like her. But a fox he befriends teaches him the most important lesson of the story: it is the time you have invested in your rose that makes her important. To tame someone is to establish ties, to create a relationship of mutual need and affection. Once you have tamed something, you become responsible for it forever.</p>
          <p>The fox also reveals the book&#39;s most famous secret: what is essential is invisible to the eye. One sees clearly only with the heart. This insight transforms the prince&#39;s understanding of his rose. She is not special because she is unique among roses; she is special because of the love and care he has invested in her. The relationship itself creates the value.</p>
          <p>The narrator and the prince develop a deep friendship during their days together in the desert. The prince helps the narrator find a well in the vast emptiness, teaching him that the search itself gives the water its sweetness. Eventually, the prince arranges to return to his planet through the snake&#39;s bite, which he describes not as death but as a journey home. The narrator is left with the memory of the prince&#39;s laughter, which he hears whenever he looks at the stars.</p>
          <p>The Little Prince has been translated into over three hundred languages and has sold more than two hundred million copies. Its simple prose carries profound philosophical weight about the nature of human connection, the dangers of losing one&#39;s inner child, and the invisible bonds that give life its deepest meaning.</p>

            <h3>What Is Essential Is Invisible to the Eye</h3>
            <p>The fox teaches the Little Prince that the most important things in life cannot be seen with the eyes but only felt with the heart. True value lies in emotional bonds, love, and shared experiences rather than in appearances or material possessions.</p>
            <blockquote>It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.</blockquote>

            <h3>The Act of Taming</h3>
            <p>To tame means to establish ties and create a unique bond of mutual dependence and affection. The fox explains that before taming, two beings are just strangers, but afterward, they need each other and the world becomes richer.</p>
            <blockquote>You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.</blockquote>

            <h3>The Absurdity of Grown-Up Behavior</h3>
            <p>Through the prince&#39;s visits to different planets, Saint-Exupéry satirizes adult preoccupations with power, vanity, addiction, and materialism. These characters have lost touch with their hearts and live in self-imposed isolation.</p>
            <blockquote>Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.</blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>The Unique Value of Relationships</h3>
            <p>The prince&#39;s rose is not objectively unique—there are thousands of identical roses—but she is infinitely valuable because of the time and love he has devoted to her. Relationships derive their meaning from investment and care, not from inherent qualities.</p>
            <blockquote>It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.</blockquote>

      <h2>About Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h2>
      <p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900–1944) was a French writer, poet, and pioneering aviator. His experiences as a mail pilot in Africa and South America deeply influenced his writing. He disappeared during a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean in 1944, and The Little Prince, published just a year before his death, became his enduring legacy.</p>
